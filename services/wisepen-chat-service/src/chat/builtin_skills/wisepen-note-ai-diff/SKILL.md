# WisePen Note AI-Diff

Use this skill when the user asks to edit, polish, translate, shorten, expand,
correct, restructure, or otherwise modify the currently opened WisePen note.

## Required workflow

1. Call `read_note_aixml` before every note edit.
2. If the application context includes `selected_text`, call
   `read_note_aixml` with `scope: "selected_note_scope"` first unless the
   user asks for broader whole-note context. This scope gives you the
   containing block context and may include multiple blocks. The selected
   text may be either the exact edit boundary or only the user's focus cue;
   infer which from the user's words.
3. Use only ids that appear in the latest `<ai_xml>` returned by the tool.
4. Build a strict AI-Diff JSON plan.
5. Call `apply_current_note_ai_diff_plan` with the exact `export_handle`
   returned by `read_note_aixml`.
6. After apply succeeds, briefly tell the user what was proposed. If the
   apply result contains conflicts or skipped operations, mention them.

Treat one successful `read_note_aixml` result as authoritative for the
current edit. Do not call `read_note_aixml` again merely to confirm context,
to compare with earlier conversation history, or because the note was edited
in a previous turn. Re-read only when the selected scope is unavailable and
you must fall back to `whole_note`, when the user explicitly asks for broader
whole-note context, or when `apply_current_note_ai_diff_plan` returns a
retryable stale/expired/mismatch result.

## Selection and scope guidance

`selected_text` is a focus signal from the application, not automatically a
hard boundary. Decide the edit scope from the user's actual wording.

- If the user explicitly says to only modify the selected text, keep other
  text unchanged, replace just this phrase/sentence, or equivalent, treat
  `selected_text` as an exact edit boundary.
- If the user asks for a broader rewrite, continuation, structural edit,
  consistency pass, or improvement that naturally involves surrounding text,
  you may edit outside `selected_text` within the requested scope.
- When the user's intended scope is ambiguous, prefer the smaller edit and
  state the scope you applied.
- Do not edit a whole block merely because the selected text is inside that
  block; edit the whole block only when the user's request calls for it.
- A selection may span multiple blocks or multiple `<text>` targets. This is
  allowed. Use multiple operations, one for each affected target, instead of
  saying the edit cannot be done.
- Do not use `add_block` or `delete_block` for selected-text-only requests
  unless the user explicitly asks to add or delete whole blocks.
- Prefer the smallest target operation that can express the user's request.
- For selected-text-only requests, do not switch from `selected_note_scope`
  to `whole_note` after a successful selected-scope read just to verify the
  same content; build the plan from that selected-scope XML.

In exact-boundary mode, remember that `replace_text` replaces the entire
`<text>` target. If `selected_text` is only part of that target, the
operation's `text` value must be the full current target text with only the
selected span replaced. Do not keep the original selected span next to its
translation, rewrite, or correction:

```text
original target text = prefix + selected_text + suffix
replacement result   = prefix + transformed_selected_text + suffix
```

Example: if `<text id="b1:t1">AAA 中文 BBB</text>` and `selected_text` is
`中文`, translating only the selection to English must produce:

```json
{ "opId": "op-1", "kind": "replace_text", "target": "b1:t1", "text": "AAA Chinese BBB" }
```

not `"Chinese"`, and not a rewritten version of `AAA` or `BBB`.
Also never produce `"AAA 中文 Chinese BBB"` for a translate-selected-text
request; the original selected span must appear zero times inside the
replaced span unless the user explicitly asks to keep it.
Also never produce `"AAA Chinese BBB Chinese"` or `"AAA Chinese Chinese BBB"`;
the transformed selected span must appear exactly once inside the affected
target unless the user explicitly asks for repetition.

If the selected text spans multiple targets, split the work across those
targets. Preserve the unselected prefix in the first target and the
unselected suffix in the last target. Fully selected middle targets may be
replaced by their transformed content. Example:

```json
[
  { "opId": "op-1", "kind": "replace_text", "target": "b1:t2", "text": "prefix translated first part" },
  { "opId": "op-2", "kind": "replace_text", "target": "b2:t1", "text": "translated second part suffix" }
]
```

In exact-boundary mode, do not say you cannot edit merely because the
selection crosses blocks. Ask the user to reselect only if the relevant
selected fragments cannot be located anywhere in the latest `<ai_xml>`.

## Hard rules

- Never submit `review_suggestions`.
- Never use operation fields named `op`, `items`, `target_id`, `targetId`,
  `type`, `before`, `after`, or `explanation`.
- Never invent block ids, text ids, links, math ids, hashes, paths, styles,
  content indexes, BlockNote JSON, or Yjs paths.
- Do not call apply before reading the note.
- The apply tool writes review suggestions. It does not directly accept or
  permanently rewrite final text.

## Formula operations

Formulas are first-class note content. Do not represent formulas as plain
text unless the user explicitly asks for plain text.

- Inline formulas appear as `<inline-math id="...">...</inline-math>`.
  Modify them with `replace_inline_math`, insert them with
  `add_inline_math`, and delete them with `delete_target`.
- Formula blocks appear as `<math-expression id="...">...</math-expression>`
  inside a `type="math"` block. Modify them with
  `replace_math_expression`.
- To add a formula block, use `add_block` with `blockType: "math"` and an
  `expression` field.
- To delete a formula block, use `delete_block` on the containing block id,
  not `delete_target` on the expression id.

## Plan schema

The top-level plan must be exactly:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "operations": []
}
```

Every operation must have:

- `opId`: unique non-empty string, for example `op-1`
- `kind`: one of `replace_text`, `replace_link`, `replace_inline_math`,
  `replace_math_expression`, `add_text`, `add_link`, `add_inline_math`,
  `add_block`, `delete_target`, `delete_block`

Valid operation shapes:

```json
{ "opId": "op-1", "kind": "replace_text", "target": "b1:t1", "text": "New text" }
{ "opId": "op-2", "kind": "replace_link", "target": "b1:l1", "text": "OpenAI", "href": "https://openai.com" }
{ "opId": "op-3", "kind": "replace_inline_math", "target": "b1:m1", "expression": "x^2" }
{ "opId": "op-4", "kind": "replace_math_expression", "target": "b2:expr", "expression": "E=mc^2" }
{ "opId": "op-5", "kind": "add_text", "anchor": "b1:t1", "position": "after", "text": " more text" }
{ "opId": "op-6", "kind": "add_link", "anchor": "b1:t1", "position": "after", "text": "source", "href": "https://example.com" }
{ "opId": "op-7", "kind": "add_inline_math", "anchor": "b1:t1", "position": "after", "expression": "a+b" }
{ "opId": "op-8", "kind": "add_block", "anchor": "b1", "position": "after", "blockType": "paragraph", "text": "New paragraph" }
{ "opId": "op-9", "kind": "add_block", "anchor": "b1", "position": "after", "blockType": "math", "expression": "E=mc^2" }
{ "opId": "op-10", "kind": "delete_target", "target": "b1:t1" }
{ "opId": "op-11", "kind": "delete_block", "target": "b1" }
```

`position` must be `before` or `after`. `blockType` must be one of
`paragraph`, `heading`, `quote`, `bulletListItem`, `numberedListItem`, or
`math`. URLs must be absolute `http` or `https` URLs.

## Error handling

- If apply returns `invalid_ai_diff_plan`, fix the JSON shape using this
  skill and retry once with the same latest XML.
- If apply returns `export_handle_expired` or `export_handle_mismatch`,
  call `read_note_aixml` again and rebuild the plan from the new XML.
- If targets are missing or stale, read again before retrying.
